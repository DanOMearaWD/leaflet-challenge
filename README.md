# Earthquake Data Visualization with Leaflet 🌍

Explore earthquake data from the past week through an interactive map built with [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/). This project visualizes data from the [USGS Earthquake API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson), displaying earthquake locations, magnitudes, and depths dynamically.

[**Live Demo**](https://danomearawd.github.io/leaflet-challenge/)

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Map**: Visualizes earthquake data dynamically.
- **Dynamic Markers**:
  - Size scales with earthquake magnitude.
  - Color reflects earthquake depth.
- **Tooltips**: Provide earthquake details (magnitude, depth, location) on click.
- **Legend**: Explains marker colors based on depth levels.
