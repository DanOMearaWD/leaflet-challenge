# Earthquake Data Visualization with Leaflet 🌍

Explore earthquake data from the past week through an interactive map built with [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/). This project visualizes data from the [USGS Earthquake API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson), displaying earthquake locations, magnitudes, and depths dynamically.

🌐 [**Live Demo**](https://danomearawd.github.io/leaflet-challenge/)

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Map**: Visualizes earthquake data dynamically.
- **Dynamic Markers**:
  - Size scales with earthquake magnitude.
  - Color reflects earthquake depth.
- **Tooltips**: Provide earthquake details (magnitude, depth, location) on click.
- **Legend**: Explains marker colors based on depth levels.

## 📝 Summary of Operations

1. **Fetch Earthquake Data**: 
   - The application fetches earthquake data in GeoJSON format from the USGS API.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - The fetched GeoJSON data is parsed to extract relevant information, including the earthquake's magnitude, depth, and location.

3. **Map Initialization**:
   - A map is initialized using Leaflet and tile layers are added to display the map’s background.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Earthquake data points are plotted on the map as markers. The size of each marker corresponds to the earthquake's magnitude, and its color reflects the depth of the earthquake.

5. **Tooltips**:
   - When a user clicks on a marker, a tooltip appears, displaying additional information about the earthquake: magnitude, depth, and location.

6. **Legend**:
   - A color-coded legend is displayed to show the relationship between marker colors and earthquake depth.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: Markup and styling to structure and design the webpage and map layout.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language used to implement the functionality for fetching, processing, and displaying earthquake data on the map.
- **Leaflet.js**: A JavaScript library for creating interactive maps, used to visualize the earthquake data.
- **D3.js**: A JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data, used for loading and displaying the GeoJSON earthquake data.
- **GeoJSON**: A format used for encoding geographic data structures, used to represent the earthquake data.
